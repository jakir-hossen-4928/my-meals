## 📊 What Was Removed?

To keep the app focused and simple, we removed:
- ❌ Profile image upload
- ❌ Cost calculator
- ❌ PDF export
- ❌ Grocery cost tracking

**Why?** These features added complexity without core value. You can still track costs through individual meal costs in the configurator.

2. Switch templates as needed
3. Meals automatically update

### **For Cost Tracking**:
